Clustering is an essential technique for network analysis, with applications in a diverse range of fields.
Although spectral clustering is a popular and effective method, it fails to consider higher-order structure and can perform poorly on directed networks.
We aim to address these shortcomings by exploring motif-based spectral clustering methods.
We present new matrix formulae for motif adjacency matrices, and a motif-based approach for clustering bipartite networks.
Comprehensive experimental results from both synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques on a variety of networks.
We conclude that motif-based spectral clustering is a valuable tool for analysis of directed and bipartite weighted networks, which is also scalable and easy to implement.
